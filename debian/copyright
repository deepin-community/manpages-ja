Project doesn't impose any additional restrictions to the translated
man pages, you can use them under the same license as the original man

distribution of the nroff sources contained in this package,
commercial distribution may impose other requirements (e.g.,
acknowledgement of copyright or inclusion of the raw nroff sources
with the commercial distribution). If you distribute these man pages
commercially, it is your responsibility to figure out your

distribute nroff sources with any pre-formatted man pages that you
provide.) Each file that contains nroff source for a man page also
contains the author(s) name, email address, and copyright notice. See
roff comments of each manpages for details.
